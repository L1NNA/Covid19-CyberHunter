# Particle Waves

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/stevenhding/pen/OJVKbbz](https://codepen.io/stevenhding/pen/OJVKbbz).

A site I'm helping out on wanted a particle wave. At first I thought of doing a background image of the animated particles but discovered threejs had these options to build one. So I borrowed some code from an already cool particle wave and customized it to created this gem!
